"This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow."
Hello everyone. My name is Ean Ntamack and I'm learning how code and program so I can learn Game development and expand myself into other fields of Computer Science like Cybersecurity and Mobile development. I alos wanted to learn how to program out of curiousity (i just find it was interesting what people can build with code). I enjoy creating drawings and love playing video games.
