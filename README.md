Hello everyone. My name is Ean Ntamack and I'm learning how code and program so I can learn Game developent and expand mysef into other  fields of Computer Science like Cyberecurity and Mobile development. I alos wanted to learn how to program out of curiousity (i just find it was interesting what people can build with code). I enjoy creating drawings and love playing video games.
